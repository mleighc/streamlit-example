    - Summarize the variety of flu-fighting nutrients in various chicken soup recipes. (interactive & static)
    - Evaluate various soup recipes based on their popularity, presence of dairy and allergens, and nutrition (interactive)
    '''
    '''With some of the limitations of the data that I had initially parsed for the static visualization, I realized early on that
    the very first Learning Objective related to ingredients would not be applicable to the interactive visualization as a result 
    of these limitations. I also found this Learning Objective to be the least interesting of the initial two that I had written.
    For this reason, I chose to write a new Learning Objective that related to additional attributes that I was able to unearth
    from my initial nutrient dataset, as well as an additional dataset parsed from the Open Food Facts website.'''

    '''The first chart, relating to the distributions of nutrient facts, is an iteration on a static visualization that
    I created for the first round of this project. This chart gives the viewer a sense of the distribution of certain
    nutritional facts throughout the set of recipes. Viewers can get a high-level comparison of where all of the recipes
    fall within this distribution and understand, for example, that a majority of the recipes are less than 20 g of
    fat and a majority of the recipes are less than 400 calories. But, if they are interested in a specific range, they also
    have the ability to adjust the interval and see how the distribution adjust along with it'''

    '''The second chart allows the viewer to see how protein and calcium related to a recipe's dairy and allergen content. 
    They also have the ability to adjust the interval to see the double-encoded distributions of dairy and allergens.
    If the viewer has a particular dietary restriction, this may help them to find the best recipe for them, perhaps with the highest
    protein content.'''

    '''The third visualization is a new iteration on the static visualization that gives viewers an overview of various
    flu-fighting nutrients in the chicken soup recipes. It provides the viewer some additional options of hovering over
    any one point, highlighting that point, viewing a tooltop of details, and then also seeing where that particular
    recipe falls in the other three scatter plots. It has also been double-encoded with Health Score to reinforce
    the ability for the viewer to truly be able to summarize the presence of these various nutrients and interpolate
    how they may impact the healthiness of a particular soup'''

    '''The final chart leverages a few more data points that might be interesting to a viewer looking for a new 
    soup recipe to try. They can filter to only the recipes at a particular serving size, compare their Fat and Calorie
    content, and then select whether they'd like a popular recipe or whether that does not particularly matter to them. 
    They are still able to compare the nutrional value of various recipes, but have the added decision-making factors
    that allow them to select a subset of recipes based on crowd-sourced popularity data and portion sizing.'''

elif chart_options_select == 'The Design Process':
    '''
    In early stages of the design process, I started out with some basic interactions on a few of the recipe attributes (as shown in
    the example above) in order to explore what might be possible with the data. The first visualization I attempted allowed the user to select both the x and y
    axes from various nutritional value options. In attempt to provide an example of this visualization, I unfortunately found that the code
    utilizing streamlit drop-down seemed to be pervasive throughout the document and display the drop-down along with every visualization despite
    attempts to remove it. This proved a challenge for moving forward with this type of interaction and so I decided to remove that from my final selection.
    '''
    st.write((c4|c5))
    '''
    I also had a few examples like the one above where I was simply playing with what variables could be included in different selectors
    or encoded with color. I felt, though, that my early interactions were quite limited since the interaction was not providing much 
    to the viewer in terms of added expressiveness.
    '''
    '''
    In some stages of the design process, I started with just a few charts in order to ensure the interaction would work
    well with the data, such as the example below. Once I was happy with the idea behind the interaction, I could then add
    additional data using the repeat function.

elif chart_options_select == 'The Data':
    '''The 300+ recipes and their respective nutrition and ingredient details have been accessed from [Spoonacular's API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
    I began by leveraging a recipe parsing document and customizing it, in order to explore the elements of the data.
    I wanted to get a sense of all of the data that was available within the set of JSON documents and spent a good amount
    of time in the early stages of the project simply trying to understand what attributes could be utilized or manipulated
    to include in visualizations. I found that the most accessible and applicable data was the nutrition and ingredient information, 
    so I began by parsing the JSON objects to access various key nutrient data points and then converting it to a pandas dataframe 
    and ultimately writing to a new CSV file.  '''
    '''
    I felt that there were some limitations for interactivity in my original data. In particular, the original ingredient data
    that I had parsed and saved to a csv file did not have enough attributes to create any interactive visualizations of interest.
    This led me to scour the internet for more information and additional data was also sourced from the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)
    website, which "is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone." This data had a lot of great attributes about manufactured chicken
    soups as opposed to my original data set of homemeade recipes, along with their countries of origin, packaging, nutritional facts, ingredients, and more.
    Howeever, the data required a lot more clean up and so ultimately only made it into one of the final visualizations I selected.'''

elif chart_options_select == 'Inspiration':
    ''''Much of my inspiration for the interactive stage of the project came from reading through the documentation for Altair. Since I am still quite
    new to Altair, I felt limited in terms of creating in altair whatever visual interactions I might have imagined in my mind. For this reason, I started reading
    through the documentation and example code for various types of inspiration and tutorials. I began by recreating the documentation examples for myself in
    order to understand how the code would work with combinations of interactions. For example, one of my visualizations is very much inspired by the example below because I felt it translated well
    into giving the viewer some insight into the distribution of recipes both with/without dairy and with/without allergens.'''

    '''In addition to reviewing the Altair documentation, I also took inspiration from previous labs in order to gain practice. While I did not
    intend to use all of the visual interactions that I recreated, I referred to these notes as I was ideating on the possible interactions to employ.
    For example, this visualization below looks very close to one of the lab examples, however I deemed the final version as lacking in effectiveness,
    since I had limitations on the types of categorical data that could prove interesting in this particular visualization.'''
